# TickTock: The Most Expensive Watches in the World


It all started when I stumbled upon an old pocket watch at a flea market. The intricate gears and timeless craftsmanship sparked a curiosity in me that quickly turned into a fascination with the world of horology. As I delved deeper, I found myself captivated by the artistry and engineering behind luxury timepieces.

This passion led me to create TickTock: Finding The Most Expensive Watches in the World, a project that uses web scraping to analyze historical auction data from Wikipedia. From rare Patek Philippes to record-breaking Rolexes, this pipeline uncovers the watches that have fetched jaw-dropping prices at auctions. While I may not be able to afford these masterpieces, researching them has been a rewarding journey through time itself.
